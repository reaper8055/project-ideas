Learning which functions and macros to use in eBPF programs requires a combination of resources, including documentation, examples, and community knowledge. Here's a detailed approach to how you can get started and continue learning:

### 1. **Documentation**

- **Linux Kernel Documentation**: The Linux kernel documentation provides extensive information on eBPF. Start with the [BPF documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/index.html).
- **eBPF and XDP Reference Guide**: This guide offers detailed descriptions of eBPF and XDP features and is available on [cilium.io](https://cilium.io/) and [ebpf.io](https://ebpf.io/).

### 2. **Examples and Tutorials**

- **bcc and bpftrace**: The `bcc` tools and `bpftrace` provide a higher-level interface to writing eBPF programs. They include many examples and can help you understand which functions and types are available.
  - The [bcc GitHub repository](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) has many examples in the `examples` directory.
  - [bpftrace](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace) is another high-level language for writing eBPF programs, and it comes with examples.

### 3. **eBPF Books**

- **"BPF Performance Tools" by Brendan Gregg**: This book is an excellent resource that covers eBPF programming in detail, including tools, techniques, and practical examples.

### 4. **Community and Forums**

- **Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML)**: The LKML is a valuable resource where developers discuss kernel development, including eBPF.
- **eBPF Slack**: Join the eBPF community on Slack where you can ask questions and get help from other eBPF developers.
- **Stack Overflow**: There is an active community of eBPF developers on Stack Overflow.

### 5. **Reading Kernel Code**

- **Kernel Source Code**: Sometimes the best way to learn is to read the kernel source code itself. The eBPF code can be found in the `kernel/bpf` directory of the Linux source tree. Functions like `bpf_get_current_pid_tgid`, `bpf_ktime_get_ns`, and others are defined there.

### Understanding the Functions and Macros

Here are explanations for some of the functions and types used in the `monitor.c` file:

- **`BPF_HASH`**: This macro creates a hash map in the eBPF program. It is used to store key-value pairs, such as process IDs and timestamps.
- **`BPF_PERF_OUTPUT`**: This macro creates a perf event output, which allows the eBPF program to send data from kernel space to user space.
- **`bpf_get_current_pid_tgid()`**: This helper function returns the current process ID and thread group ID.
- **`bpf_ktime_get_ns()`**: This helper function returns the current time in nanoseconds since the system boot.
- **`bpf_get_current_comm()`**: This helper function retrieves the name of the current task (process) and stores it in a buffer.
- **`PT_REGS_PARM1(ctx)`**: This macro accesses the first parameter of the function being traced.

### Learning Path

1. **Start with Basic Tutorials**:
   - Begin with simple examples that trace system calls, monitor network traffic, or count events.
   
2. **Move to More Advanced Programs**:
   - Once you're comfortable with basic programs, try writing more complex eBPF programs that require handling multiple events, using maps for data storage, and interacting with user space.

3. **Experiment with `bcc` and `bpftrace`**:
   - Use `bcc` and `bpftrace` to write and run eBPF programs. These tools abstract some of the complexities and allow you to focus on learning eBPF concepts.

4. **Read and Modify Examples**:
   - Read existing examples from the `bcc` repository and other sources. Try modifying them to understand how different parts work.

5. **Refer to Documentation Regularly**:
   - Keep the Linux kernel and eBPF documentation handy and refer to it frequently as you encounter new concepts and functions.

By following these steps and utilizing the available resources, you can build a strong understanding of eBPF programming and become proficient in writing and using eBPF programs.
